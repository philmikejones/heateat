# Heateat #

## Overview ##
This project began life as a number of maps for the ['Heat or eat' project](http://www.communitiesandculture.org/projects/heat-or-eat-food-and-austerity-in-rural-england/) for the [Communities and Culture Network](http://www.communitiesandculture.org/).

It now uses open data for fuel poverty (gov.uk), food bank locations (tbc), and boundary data (census.ukdataservice.ac.uk).

The code produces a vignette with a map for South Yorkshire, showing:

1. The locations of foodbanks.
1. Fuel poverty at LSOA level.
1. LADs for context.

## Acknowledgements and sources ##

Boundary files were obtained through the [UK Data Service Census Support](http://census.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/boundary-data.aspx) and are available under the Open Government License.

Fuel poverty data is obtained from [Gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/2013-sub-regional-fuel-poverty-data-low-income-high-costs-indicator).

Food bank locations are obtained from OpenStreetMap.
