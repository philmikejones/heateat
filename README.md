'Heat or eat' mapping project. Designed to highlight locations of foodbanks, the number of clients they help, and if they're in a rural or urban area. The maps, in addition, show fuel poverty (either LSOA priority areas or top quintile (20%) of MSOAs). Finally, district local authorities, unitary authorities, and London Boroughs (LADs) are shown for context.

Data and geographical boundary data (shape files) are not provided because of their licenses. The code is meant to illustrate how ggplot and R spatial packages can be used for mapping purposes, only.
