Mapping for the ['Heat or eat' project](http://www.communitiesandculture.org/projects/heat-or-eat-food-and-austerity-in-rural-england/) for the [Communities and Culture Network](http://www.communitiesandculture.org/).

The code produces one map for each English region, and one for Greater London. Each regional map shows:

1. The locations of foodbanks.
2. The number of clients who have used the foodbank.
3. Rural areas eligible for support under the Carbon Saving Communities Obligation (CSCO).
4. District local authorities, unitary authorities, and London Boroughs (LADs) are shown for context.

Boundary files were obtained through the [UK Data Service Census Support](http://census.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/boundary-data.aspx) and are available under the Open Government License.
